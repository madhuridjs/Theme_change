                The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written
                in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, 
                and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was 
                the original paragraphs, similar to an
                Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
                The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of
                Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.
